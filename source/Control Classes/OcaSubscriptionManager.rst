1.3.4  OcaSubscriptionManager
=============================

Class Hirarchy:

:ref:`OcaRoot <ocaroot>` :raw:html:`&rarr;` :ref:`OcaManager <ocamanager>` :raw:html:`&rarr;` :ref:`OcaSubscriptionManager <ocasubscriptionmanager>` 

.. cpp:class:: OcaSubscriptionManager: OcaManager

    Manager that collects and controls the event subscriptions of the device.  
    
     - Must be instantiated once in every device that supports subscriptions.
     
    
     - May be instantiated at most once in any device.
     
    
     - If instantiated, must have object number 4.
      Absence of an  **OcaSubscriptionManager** object signifies that the device does not support event subscriptions.

    **Properties**:

    .. _ocasubscriptionmanager_classid:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaClassID ClassID

        Number that uniquely identifies the class. Note that this differs from the object number, which identifies the instantiated object. This property is an override of the  **OcaRoot** property.

        This property has id ``3.1``.

    .. _ocasubscriptionmanager_classversion:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaClassVersionNumber ClassVersion

        Identifies the interface version of the class. Any change to the class definition leads to a higher class version. This property is an override of the  **OcaRoot** property.

        This property has id ``3.2``.

    .. _ocasubscriptionmanager_state:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaSubscriptionManagerState State

        Events enabled or disabled. When events are disabled, (1) Only notification from the subscription manager itself are sent to subscribers, and (2) the subscription manager saves the object numbers of all objects that raise events while notifications are disabled. The saved numbers are eventually returned by the  **SynchronizeState** event that occurs when notifications are re-enabled.

        This property has id ``3.1``.

    **Methods**:

    .. _ocasubscriptionmanager_removesubscription:

    .. cpp:function:: OcaStatus RemoveSubscription(OcaEvent Event, OcaMethod Subscriber)

        Removes all subscriptions to the given event with the given  **OcaMethod** . The return value indicates whether the subscription(s) was (were) successfully removed.

        This method has id ``3.2``.

        :param OcaEvent Event: Input parameter.
        :param OcaMethod Subscriber: Input parameter.

    .. _ocasubscriptionmanager_addsubscription:

    .. cpp:function:: OcaStatus AddSubscription(OcaEvent Event, OcaMethod Subscriber, OcaBlob SubscriberContext, OcaNotificationDeliveryMode NotificationDeliveryMode, OcaNetworkAddress DestinationInformation)

        Adds a subscription to an event. The subscription is added for the session on which the command came in. If a subscription identical to the one being requested already exists, an additional one shall not be added. Two subscriptions are identical if the  **Event, Subscriber, NotificationDeliveryMode** , and  **DestinationInformation** parameters are all identical. The return value indicates whether the subscription succeeded.

        This method has id ``3.1``.

        :param OcaEvent Event: Input parameter.
        :param OcaMethod Subscriber: Input parameter.
        :param OcaBlob SubscriberContext: Input parameter.
        :param OcaNotificationDeliveryMode NotificationDeliveryMode: Input parameter.
        :param OcaNetworkAddress DestinationInformation: Input parameter.

    .. _ocasubscriptionmanager_disablenotifications:

    .. cpp:function:: OcaStatus DisableNotifications()

        Temporarily disables emitting of event notifications (to all subscribers, not just to the subscriber calling this method). Events from the Subscription Manager itself are not disabled. This method can be used if either a controller or the local device knows that it is going to change the state of the device significantly, which could lead to a notification storm of events. Invoking this method will prevent the notification storm. The event '03e01 EventsDisabled' will be raised to notify all controllers of the fact that events are temporarily disabled. The subscription manager will start collecting the object numbers of the objects that raise events, so that it can pass a list of changed objects once the events are re-enabled. The return value indicates if disabling events succeeded.

        This method has id ``3.3``.


    .. _ocasubscriptionmanager_reenablenotifications:

    .. cpp:function:: OcaStatus ReEnableNotifications()

        Re-enables the sending of event notifications to all subscribers. When events are re-enabled, the subscription manager will raise the  **SynchronizeState** event, passing the list of objects that have changed state. Subsequently, the subscription manager will transmit all notifications as normal. If the connection to the controller that invoked the DisableEvents() is lost, this method will be called automatically to prevent the situation in which the raising of events would never be re-enabled. The return value indicates if re-enabling the event-based events succeeded.

        This method has id ``3.4``.


    .. _ocasubscriptionmanager_addpropertychangesubscription:

    .. cpp:function:: OcaStatus AddPropertyChangeSubscription(OcaONo Emitter, OcaPropertyID Property, OcaMethod Subscriber, OcaBlob SubscriberContext, OcaNotificationDeliveryMode NotificationDeliveryMode, OcaNetworkAddress DestinationInformation)

        Adds a subscription to the PropertyChanged event in the object Emitter for changes of the property Property. If the NotificationDeliveryMode is Fast, the subscription is added for the session on which the command came in. If a subscription identical to the one being requested already exists, an additional one shall not be added. Two subscriptions are identical if the Emitter, Property, Subscriber, SubsciberContext, NotificationDeliveryMode, and DestinationInformation parameters are all identical. The return value indicates whether the subscription succeeded. Added in v2 of this class, in AES70-2017.

        This method has id ``3.5``.

        :param OcaONo Emitter: Input parameter.
        :param OcaPropertyID Property: Input parameter.
        :param OcaMethod Subscriber: Input parameter.
        :param OcaBlob SubscriberContext: Input parameter.
        :param OcaNotificationDeliveryMode NotificationDeliveryMode: Input parameter.
        :param OcaNetworkAddress DestinationInformation: Input parameter.

    .. _ocasubscriptionmanager_removepropertychangesubscription:

    .. cpp:function:: OcaStatus RemovePropertyChangeSubscription(OcaONo Emitter, OcaPropertyID Property, OcaMethod Subscriber)

        Removes any subscription to a PropertyChanged event with the given Emitter, Property, Subscriber, SubscriberContext, NotificationDeliveryMode, and DestinationInformation. The return value indicates whether the subscription(s) was (were) successfully removed. Added in v2 of this class, in AES70-2017.

        This method has id ``3.6``.

        :param OcaONo Emitter: Input parameter.
        :param OcaPropertyID Property: Input parameter.
        :param OcaMethod Subscriber: Input parameter.

    .. _ocasubscriptionmanager_getmaximumsubscribercontextlength:

    .. cpp:function:: OcaStatus GetMaximumSubscriberContextLength(OcaUint16 &Max)

        Returns maximum byte length of payload of subscriber context parameter that this device supports. This returned value shall be either zero or four. If the returned payload length is not zero, it shall be four. No other values shall be allowed, and the returned value shall not change once the device has initialized. NOTE: In AES70-2015, arbitrary subscriber context lengths were allowed; this is no longer true.

        This method has id ``3.7``.

        :param OcaUint16 Max: Output parameter.
