Extends :ref:`OcaAgent <ocaagent>`.

.. cpp:class:: OcaRamper: OcaAgent

    Agent that gradually changes a property setting from one value to
    another. Works on a scalar numeric or boolean property of a specified
    object. Does not work for array, list, map, struct, or string
    properties. Contains timer features to allow ramps to start
    immediately or at any time in the future. This is a weakly typed
    class. All ramping parameters are specified as a **OcaFloat64**
    numbers.
    
    - For unsigned integer targets, the ramping parameters are coerced to
    **OcaUint64** before comparing.
    
    
    - For signed integer targets, the ramping parameters are coerced to
    **OcaInt64** before comparing.
    
    
    - For boolean values, the the ramping parameters are coerced to
    **OcaUint8.** True is assigned the value One, False is assigned the
    value Zero.
