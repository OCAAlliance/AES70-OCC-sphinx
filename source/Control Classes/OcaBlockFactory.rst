.. cpp:class:: OcaBlockFactory: OcaWorker

    Factory to create custom block instances. Used only in reconfigurable
    devices. The idea is that you instantiate a factory once, populate it
    with proto-objects and proto-signal paths, then use it subsequently to
    instantiate identical blocks. In this context, **proto-object** means
    a prototype of a block member. Unbound objects are identified by
    **proto-object numbers (PONo's)** instead of actual object numbers.
    PONos are unique within the factory, and are converted to globally
    unique object numbers ONos) in all new block instances that the
    factory builds. Correspondingly, **proto-signal path** means a signal
    path expressed in terms of **PONos** rather than **ONos** . When the
    factory constructs a block, it converts all of its unbound signal
    paths to normal (bound) signal paths by mapping its **PONos** into
    **ONos** . The factory also holds a list of **proto-blockports** which
    are **OcaPorts** that are allocated to new blocks the factory builds.
    As well, the proto-objects in the factory may contain lists of their
    own proto-ports. Together, the factory's proto-ports and its members'
    proto-ports are used to define the factory's set of proto-signal
    paths. Factories may be predefined at time of device manufacture, or
    constructed "on the fly" by controllers. To **create a factory** , the
    controller calls a block's **CreateMember(...)** method with the
    **ClassID** of this class ( **OcaBlockFactory** ). Factories ignore
    which block creates them, so it makes no difference which block's
    **CreateMember(...)** method is used. It will usually make the most
    sense to use the Root Block's method. To add proto-objects,
    proto-ports, and proto-signal paths to a block factory, the controller
    calls the factory's **DefineProtoMember(...), DefineProtoPort(...),
    and DefineProtoSignalPath(...** ) methods, respectively.
