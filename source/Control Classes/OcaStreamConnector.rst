.. cpp:class:: OcaStreamConnector: OcaAgent

    **DEPRECATED CLASS** *Replaced by the* **OcaMediaSinkConnector **
    *and* **OcaMediaSourceConnector ** *datatypes in version 3 of
    Connection Management (CM3)* Agent class for objects ("connectors")
    that allow connection of streams to the device. Streams may be single
    channels or multichannel groups. A connector is either a *source* or a
    *sink.* Sources are sometimes called "talkers". Sinks are sometimes
    called "listeners". Each connector links to zero or more **OcaStream**
    data objects. Each **OcaStream** object represents a signal flow to or
    from a local connector to a remote connector. The remote connector is
    usually, but not necessarily, in a different node. Each connector
    collects zero or more *signal channels* . A signal channel is an
    instance of **OcaNetworkSignalChannel.** Each signal channel exposes
    one media channel of the stream to the interior of the device. A
    signal channel therefore is a Worker that contains exactly one
    **OcaPort** data object. Each **OcaStreamConnector** object belongs to
    a particular instance of **OcaStreamNetwork** or a subclass of
    **OcaStreamNetwork** **.** Each **OcaStreamConnector** is linked to
    its network through the **Owner** property.
    
    - When a controller creates an **OcaStreamConnector** object
    dynamically, the controller must store the Object Number of the
    corresponding **OcaStreamNetwork** object in the **Owner** property.
    
    
    - Upon receiving the **Owner** property change, the
    **OcaStreamConnector** object must register itself with the given
    stream network object via some internal means.
    This class may be subclassed to support various network types.

    .. cpp:member:: OcaClassID ClassID

        This property has id ``3.0``.

        ID of this class

    .. cpp:member:: OcaClassVersionNumber ClassVersion

        This property has id ``3.0``.

        Version number of this class

    .. cpp:member:: OcaStreamConnectorID IDAdvertised

        This property has id ``3.0``.

        Character name or binary identifier of this connector. This ID is
        advertised on the network to be found by other devices' discovery
        processes.

    .. cpp:member:: OcaONo OwnerNetwork

        This property has id ``3.0``.

        Object number of stream network object ( **OcaStreamNetwork** or one
        of its subclasses) to which this connector belongs. In reconfigurable
        devices, a controller that creates an **OcaStreamConnector** object
        must store the appropriate stream network object number into this
        property. It is assumed that, upon receiving a value into its
        **Owner** property, the terminus object will by internal means
        register itself with the identified stream network.

    .. cpp:member:: OcaMap<OcaStreamConnectorPinIndex, OcaONo> Pins

        This property has id ``3.0``.

        The map of connector pin indexes to
        **OcaNetworkSignalChannel[Source|Sink]** objects collected by this
        connector. The pin indexes are _fixed indexes_ 1 to n, where n is the
        number of channels the connector accommodates (determined when the
        connector is created). If a certain pin in the connector is currently
        not attached the OcaONo of that index is 0.

    .. cpp:member:: OcaNetworkMediaSourceOrSink SourceOrSink

        This property has id ``3.0``.

        Specifies whether this connector is for output (source) or input
        (sink) signal channels.
