.. cpp:class:: OcaFirmwareManager: OcaManager

    Optional manager that manages versions of the different firmware and software images of the device.  
    
     - May be instantiated at most once in any device.
     
    
     - If instantiated, must have object number 3.
      A device that does not support firmware updating may support the subset of this class's functions needed to report firmware version numbers to inquiring controllers. This firmware manager offers a generic interface for updating OCA devices. The actual robustness of the update process is left up to the implementer. The interface allows for any of: - Fully transactional based uploads (i.e. only committing to the newly uploaded images after all component uploads have succeeded, and reverting back to the old images if any step fails) - Partly transactional based uploads (i.e. committing to a newly uploaded image after each individual component upload succeeds, possibly leading to a device containing a mix of old and new images) - Non-transactional based uploads guarded by golden images (i.e. accepting a 'weak' spot in the upload process where interruption may lead to a corrupt regular image, which is solved by loading a read-only failsafe ("golden") image in such cases that will allow recovery of the regular image) - Non-transactional based uploads that may lead to bricked devices

    **Properties**:

    .. _ocafirmwaremanager_classid:

    .. cpp:member:: static const OcaClassID ClassID = "1.3.3"

        Number that uniquely identifies the class. Note that this differs from the object number, which identifies the instantiated object. This property is an override of the  **OcaRoot** property.

        This property has id ``3.1``.

    .. _ocafirmwaremanager_classversion:

    .. cpp:member:: static const OcaClassVersionNumber ClassVersion = 2

        Identifies the interface version of the class. Any change to the class definition leads to a higher class version. This property is an override of the  **OcaRoot** property.

        This property has id ``3.2``.

    .. _ocafirmwaremanager_componentversions:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaList<OcaVersion> ComponentVersions

        List of the versions of the components of the device. As of version 2 of this class, component numbers are of datatype **OcaEnum,** rather than the previous  **OcaUint16.** 

        This property has id ``3.1``.

    **Methods**:

    .. _ocafirmwaremanager_getcomponentversions:

    .. cpp:function:: OcaStatus GetComponentVersions(OcaList<OcaVersion> &componentVersions)

        Gets the value of the ComponentVersions property. The return value indicates whether the property was successfully retrieved.

        This method has id ``3.1``.

        :param OcaList<OcaVersion> componentVersions: Output parameter.

    .. _ocafirmwaremanager_startupdateprocess:

    .. cpp:function:: OcaStatus StartUpdateProcess()

        Marks the start of the update process of an OCA device, meaning one or more components will be updated. If the method succeeds the device will be in state 'Updating'. One or more active or passive updates can then follow, after which the update process is ended by calling the '03m08 EndUpdateProcess' method. The return value indicates if starting the update process succeeded.

        This method has id ``3.2``.


    .. _ocafirmwaremanager_beginactiveimageupdate:

    .. cpp:function:: OcaStatus BeginActiveImageUpdate(OcaComponent component)

        Starts an active update of a software/firmware image on the device. This generic interface can be used to update any component which can be updated actively, i.e. where the upload tool actively pushes the software/firmware image to the firmware manager. The actual firmware manager implementation may implement separate processes for different components, but in each case the interface is the same. The active interface consists of this method and the methods 03m03 AddImageData, 03m04 VerifyImage and 03m05 EndActiveImageUpdate. The return value indicates if starting the active update succeeded.

        This method has id ``3.3``.

        :param OcaComponent component: Input parameter.

    .. _ocafirmwaremanager_addimagedata:

    .. cpp:function:: OcaStatus AddImageData(OcaUint32 id, OcaBlob imageData)

        Adds a new part of the software/firmware image to the upgrade memory as part of the active update. Where this data is stored, is up to the implementation of the manager. It can either be stored in RAM to be written to Flash later, or directly to Flash, dependent on the chosen architecture and requirements. The return value indicates whether the data is correctly received and the data is not out of order.

        This method has id ``3.4``.

        :param OcaUint32 id: Input parameter.
        :param OcaBlob imageData: Input parameter.

    .. _ocafirmwaremanager_verifyimage:

    .. cpp:function:: OcaStatus VerifyImage(OcaBlob verifyData)

        Verifies the entire host processor image using the passed verification data.

        This method has id ``3.5``.

        :param OcaBlob verifyData: Input parameter.

    .. _ocafirmwaremanager_endactiveimageupdate:

    .. cpp:function:: OcaStatus EndActiveImageUpdate()

        Ends the active software/firmware image update. This is needed to let the device know that the current active component has finished, and therefore a new active or passive update can be started (or the upload process can be ended by invoking the '03m08 EndUpdateProcess' method). The return value indicates if ending the active update succeeded.

        This method has id ``3.6``.


    .. _ocafirmwaremanager_beginpassivecomponentupdate:

    .. cpp:function:: OcaStatus BeginPassiveComponentUpdate(OcaComponent component, OcaNetworkAddress serverAddress, OcaString updateFileName)

        Begin a passive software/firmware component update. This generic interface can be used for any component that can be passively updated, i.e. where the device requests the actual software/firmware image from an external server. In the function the component type, details of the server and the filename of the file containing the component software/firmware image needs to be passed. The device will try to retrieve the new software/firmware image from the server and update its component using this image. The actual method for retrieving the image (e.g. TFTP) and the underlying update technique (e.g. netflash) depend on the implementation and may differ between components. Just the interface is standardized.

        This method has id ``3.7``.

        :param OcaComponent component: Input parameter.
        :param OcaNetworkAddress serverAddress: Input parameter.
        :param OcaString updateFileName: Input parameter.

    .. _ocafirmwaremanager_endupdateprocess:

    .. cpp:function:: OcaStatus EndUpdateProcess()

        Ends the current update process in which one or more components haven been updated (actively or passively). This action will trigger the device to start using the new images. This should bring the device back into standard operational mode (e.g. rebooting the device, this however depends on the implementation of the upgrade process). As it will usually trigger a reset of the device in some cases no response parameter is used for this method.

        This method has id ``3.8``.
