.. cpp:class:: OcaNetworkSignalChannel: OcaWorker

    **DEPRECATED CLASS** *Replaced by features of the*
    **OcaMediaSinkConnector ** *and* **OcaMediaSourceConnector **
    *datatypes in version 3 of Connection Management (CM3)* Worker that
    allows connection of one or more internal signal paths to a network
    signal channel.
    
    - For stream-oriented media connection management such as used by AVB,
    this worker will be linked to an **OcaStreamConnector** object and to
    the appropriate **OcaStreamNetwork** object.
    
    
    - For channel-oriented media connection management, such as the Dante
    name-based routing mechanism, this worker will be linked only to the
    **OcaStreamNetwork** object.
    

    **Properties**:

    .. _ocanetworksignalchannel_classid:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaClassID ClassID

        ID of this class

        This property has id ``3.1``.

    .. _ocanetworksignalchannel_classversion:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaClassVersionNumber ClassVersion

        Version number of this class

        This property has id ``3.2``.

    .. _ocanetworksignalchannel_connectorpins:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaMap<OcaONo, OcaStreamConnectorPinIndex> ConnectorPins

        Map of object numbers of **OcaStreamConnector** objects to
        **OcaStreamConnectorPinIndex** of these connectors. This map
        identifies which **OcaStreamConnector** objects contain this network
        signal channel, and indicates at what pin of the connector this
        channel is found. If the **OcaNetworkSignalChannel** object is not
        part of any **OcaStreamConnector** this map is empty. Note that
        **OcaNetworkSignalChannel** objects of type **Sink** cannot have more
        than one entry in the map, else it would implicitly perform mixing.
        **OcaNetworkSignalChannel** objects of type **Source** can have
        multiple entries in the map.

        This property has id ``3.3``.

    .. _ocanetworksignalchannel_idadvertised:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaNetworkSignalChannelID IDAdvertised

        Character name or binary identifier of the port that is advertised on
        the network to be found by other devices' discovery processes.
        Depending on the media transport architecture being used, this ID may
        be globally unique throughout the network, or only unique within the
        scope of the specific Network instance to which the port is attached.

        This property has id ``3.1``.

    .. _ocanetworksignalchannel_network:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaONo Network

        Object number of stream network object ( **OcaStreamNetwork** or one
        of its subclasses) to which this signal channel belongs.

        This property has id ``3.2``.

    .. _ocanetworksignalchannel_remotechannelid:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaNetworkSignalChannelID RemoteChannelID

        External ID of ultimate source or destination of signal.

        This property has id ``3.4``.

    .. _ocanetworksignalchannel_sourceorsink:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaNetworkMediaSourceOrSink SourceOrSink

        Describes whether this signal channel is source (emits signals into
        the network) or sink (receives signals from the network). Sources are
        sometimes called "talkers", and sinks are sometimes called
        "listeners".

        This property has id ``3.5``.

    .. _ocanetworksignalchannel_status:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaNetworkSignalChannelStatus Status

        Status of the port

        This property has id ``3.6``.

    **Methods**:

    .. _ocanetworksignalchannel_addtoconnector:

    .. cpp:function:: OcaStatus AddToConnector(OcaONo Connector, OcaStreamConnectorPinIndex Index)

        Adds the object number of the stream connector object to which this
        media port belongs, and specifies on what index of the stream
        connector this channel can be found. Return status indicates success
        of operation.

        This method has id ``3.6``.

        :param OcaONo Connector: Input parameter.
        :param OcaStreamConnectorPinIndex Index: Input parameter.

        media port belongs, if any. If port does not belong to a stream
        connector, returns zero. Return status indicates success of operation.
