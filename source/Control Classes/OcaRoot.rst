Class Hirarchy:

:ref:`OcaRoot <ocaroot>` 

.. cpp:class:: OcaRoot

    The abstract root class of which all OCA classes derive. It offers
    basic OCA functionality such as locking an object and generalized data
    access.

    **Properties**:

    .. _ocaroot_classid:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaClassID ClassID

        Number that uniquely identifies the class. Note that this differs from
        the object number, which identifies the instantiated object. This is a
        class property instead of an object property. This property will be
        overridden by each descendant class, in order to specify that class's
        ClassID.

        This property has id ``1.1``.

    .. _ocaroot_classversion:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaClassVersionNumber ClassVersion

        Identifies the interface version of the class. Any change to the class
        definition leads to a higher class version. This property will be
        overridden by each descendant class, in order to specify that class's
        ClassVersion.

        This property has id ``1.2``.

    .. _ocaroot_objectnumber:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaONo ObjectNumber

        The object number that uniquely identifies the instantiated object.
        This read-only property must be set at creation of the object. Derived
        objects can hardcode the object number in its constructor, or offer a
        constructor with object number parameter for dynamic allocation of
        object numbers.

        This property has id ``1.3``.

    .. _ocaroot_lockable:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaBoolean Lockable

        Read-only property that indicates whether the object is lockable or
        non-lockable. The property value must be set during construction of
        the object.

        This property has id ``1.4``.

    .. _ocaroot_role:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaString Role

        Read-only text property that describes object's role in the device.
        Particularly useful for workers, e.g. "Input 1 Gain".

        This property has id ``1.5``.


    **Methods**:

    .. _ocaroot_getclassidentification:

    .. cpp:function:: OcaStatus GetClassIdentification(OcaClassIdentification &ClassIdentification)

        Gets the class identification, a structure that contains the ClassID
        and ClassVersion. The return value indicates whether the property was
        successfully retrieved.

        This method has id ``1.1``.

        :param OcaClassIdentification ClassIdentification: Output parameter.

    .. _ocaroot_getlockable:

    .. cpp:function:: OcaStatus GetLockable(OcaBoolean &lockable)

        Gets the value of the Lockable property. The return value indicates
        whether the property was successfully retrieved.

        This method has id ``1.2``.

        :param OcaBoolean lockable: Output parameter.

    .. _ocaroot_locktotal:

    .. cpp:function:: OcaStatus LockTotal()

        Locks the object totally, so that it can only be accessed for reading
        or writing by the lockholder. If the device is read-only locked (by a
        prior call to LockReadonly()) when Lock() is called by the same
        lockholder, the lock state is upgraded to total. If the call is from a
        session other than the lockholder's, the call fails. The return value
        indicates whether the operation succeeded.

        This method has id ``1.3``.


    .. _ocaroot_unlock:

    .. cpp:function:: OcaStatus Unlock()

        Unlocks the object so that it can be freely accessed again. This
        method can only succeed if it is called by the lockholder. The return
        value indicates whether the operation succeeded.

        This method has id ``1.4``.


    .. _ocaroot_getrole:

    .. cpp:function:: OcaStatus GetRole(OcaString &Role)

        Returns value of Role property. The return value indicates whether the
        operation succeeded.

        This method has id ``1.5``.

        :param OcaString Role: Output parameter.

    .. _ocaroot_lockreadonly:

    .. cpp:function:: OcaStatus LockReadonly()

        Locks the object so that its properties may only be modified by the
        lockholder, but others can still retrieve property values. If the
        device is already locked (by a prior call to Lock() or LockReadonly())
        when LockReadonly() is called by the same lockholder, the lock state
        is set to read-only. If the call is from a session other than the
        lockholder's, the call fails. The return value indicates whether the
        operation succeeded.

        This method has id ``1.6``.
