===========================

Class Hierarchy:

:ref:`OcaRoot <ocaroot>` :raw:html:`&rarr;` :ref:`OcaManager <ocamanager>` :raw:html:`&rarr;` :ref:`OcaMediaClockManager <ocamediaclockmanager>` 

.. cpp:class:: OcaMediaClockManager: OcaManager

    Optional manager that collects all media clocks the device uses.  
    
     - Must be instantiated once for every device that has more than one media clock object. In this context, "media clock" means an instance of  **OcaMediaClock** ,  **OcaMediaClock3** , or any subclass of these classes.
       
    
     - If instantiated, object number must be 7.
     

    **Properties**:

    .. _ocamediaclockmanager_classid:

    .. cpp:member:: static const OcaClassID ClassID = "1.3.7"

        Number that uniquely identifies the class. Note that this differs from the object number, which identifies the instantiated object. This property is an override of the  **OcaRoot** property.

        This property has id ``3.1``.

    .. _ocamediaclockmanager_classversion:

    .. cpp:member:: static const OcaClassVersionNumber ClassVersion = 2

        Identifies the interface version of the class. Any change to the class definition leads to a higher class version. This property is an override of the  **OcaRoot** property.

        This property has id ``3.2``.

    .. _ocamediaclockmanager_clocksourcetypessupported:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaList<OcaMediaClockType> ClockSourceTypesSupported

        List of clock source types supported by  **OcaMediaClock** objects in this device. Note: In AES70-2017, this method is deprecated. It only reflects the clock types of  **OcaMediaClock** objects, which are now deprecated. It does not apply to  **OcaMediaClock3** objects, since these do not have type attributes. If the number of  **OcaMediaClock** objects in the device is zero, this property is empty.

        This property has id ``3.1``.

    .. _ocamediaclockmanager_clocks:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaList<OcaONo> Clocks

        Object numbers of  **OcaMediaClock** objects, one for each clock which this device uses and/or sources. Note: In AES70-2017, this property is deprecated.

        This property has id ``3.2``.

    .. _ocamediaclockmanager_clock3s:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaList<OcaONo> Clock3s

        Object numbers of  **OcaMediaClock3** objects, one for each clock which this device uses and/or sources.

        This property has id ``3.3``.

    **Methods**:

    .. _ocamediaclockmanager_getclocks:

    .. cpp:function:: OcaStatus GetClocks(OcaList<OcaONo> &Clocks)

        Gets the list of object numbers of  **OcaMediaClock** instances in this device. Return value indicates whether list was successfully retrieved. Note: In AES70-2017, this method is deprecated.

        This method has id ``3.1``.

        :param OcaList<OcaONo> Clocks: Output parameter.

    .. _ocamediaclockmanager_getmediaclocktypessupported:

    .. cpp:function:: OcaStatus GetMediaClockTypesSupported(OcaList<OcaMediaClockType> &MediaClockTypes)

        Gets the list of media clock types supported by  **OcaMediaClock** objects in the device. Return value indicates whether the list was successfully retrieved. Note : In AES70-2017, this method is deprecated.

        This method has id ``3.2``.

        :param OcaList<OcaMediaClockType> MediaClockTypes: Output parameter.

    .. _ocamediaclockmanager_getclock3s:

    .. cpp:function:: OcaStatus GetClock3s(OcaList<OcaONo> &Clocks)

        Gets the list of object numbers of  **OcaMediaClock3** instances in this device. Return value indicates whether list was successfully retrieved.

        This method has id ``3.3``.

        :param OcaList<OcaONo> Clocks: Output parameter.
