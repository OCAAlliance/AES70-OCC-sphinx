.. cpp:class:: OcaNumericObserverList: OcaAgent

    Observer of a scalar numeric or boolean property ("target property")
    of a set of specified objects. This class is a subclass of
    **OcaNumericObserver** , and differs from that class only in that it
    observes a set of properties rather than a single property. Does not
    work for array, list, map, struct, or string properties.
    **OcaNumericObserverList** emits an **Observation** event under
    certain conditions. There are three kinds of conditions:
    
    - **Numeric comparison** . A target property value meets a certain
    comparison condition. A selection of comparison operators is
    available. Such observations are called "asynchronous observations".
    
    
    - **Timer expiry** . The value of the **Period** property, if nonzero,
    is a the time interval for the recurrent timed emission of
    **Observation** events. Such events ("periodic observations") are
    emitted regardless of the target property's value.
    
    
    - **Combination of (1) and (2)** . If a numeric comparison and a
    nonzero period are both specified, then the **Observation** event is
    emitted when the timer expires **and** the numeric comparison is true
    for at least one of the observed properties. Such observations are
    called "conditional-periodic observations".
    This is a weakly typed class. Its threshold is specified as an
    **OcaFloat64** number.
    
    - For unsigned integer targets, the threshold and target are both
    coerced to **OcaUint64** before comparing.
    
    
    - For signed integer targets, the threshold and target are both
    coerced to **OcaInt64** before comparing.
    
    
    - For boolean values, the threshold hreshold and target are both
    coerced to **OcaUint8** , True is assigned the value One, False is
    assigned the value Zero.
    Note that this coercion may result in rounding errors if the observed
    datatype is of type OcaUint64 or OcaUint64. An **OcaNumericObserver**
    instance and the property it observes are bound at the time the
    **OcaNumericObserver** instance is constructed. For static devices,
    construction will occur during manufacture, or possibly during a
    subsequent hardware configuration step. For reconfigurable devices,
    construction might be done by online controllers as part of device
    configuration sessions. This class is normally used for monitoring
    readings of sensor readings, but may be used equally well for watching
    workers' parameter settings.

    **Properties**:

    .. _ocanumericobserverlist_classid:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaClassID ClassID

        Number that uniquely identifies the class. Note that this differs from
        the object number, which identifies the instantiated object. This
        property is an override of the **OcaRoot** property.

        This property has id ``3.1``.

    .. _ocanumericobserverlist_classversion:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaClassVersionNumber ClassVersion

        Identifies the interface version of the class. Any change to the class
        definition leads to a higher class version. This property is an
        override of the **OcaRoot** property.

        This property has id ``3.2``.

    .. _ocanumericobserverlist_state:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaObserverState State

        State: triggered, not triggered

        This property has id ``3.1``.

    .. _ocanumericobserverlist_observedproperties:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaList<OcaProperty> ObservedProperties

        List of identifiers of the properties are being observed.

        This property has id ``3.2``.

    .. _ocanumericobserverlist_threshold:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaFloat64 Threshold

        Comparison value for raising the **Triggered** event.

        This property has id ``3.3``.

    .. _ocanumericobserverlist_operator:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaRelationalOperator Operator

        Relational operator used when comparing the value of the observed
        property to the threshold value.

        This property has id ``3.4``.

    .. _ocanumericobserverlist_twoway:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaBoolean TwoWay

        True to emit a **Triggered** event upon crossing the threshold in
        either direction; false to emit only upon crossing in the primary
        direction (i.e. rising when **Operator** is set to _GreaterThan_ or
        _GreaterThanOrEqual_ ; falling when **Operator** is set to _LessThan_
        or _LessThanOrEqual_ ; equality when **Operator** is set to _Equality_
        ; inequality when **Operator** is set to _Inequality_ ).

        This property has id ``3.5``.

    .. _ocanumericobserverlist_hysteresis:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaFloat64 Hysteresis

        Hysteresis that is used when observing the property value. This
        indicates which amount must be added/subtracted from the **Threshold**
        value to raise or re-enable the **Triggered** event of this
        **OcaObserver** object. The rules for hysteresis handling depend upon
        the configured **Operator** and **TwoWay** properties. The
        **Hysteresis** property is ignored if the **Operator** property is
        'Inequality'. If the State is **Not Triggered** it changes to
        **Triggered** if _any_ of the ObservedProperties reaches the
        Threshold. If the State is **Triggered** it changes to **Not
        Triggered** only if _all_ of the ObservedProperties no longer meet the
        ‘Threshold including Hysteresis’ **.**

        This property has id ``3.6``.

    .. _ocanumericobserverlist_period:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaTimeInterval Period

        Repetition period or zero. If nonzero, the observer will retrieve the
        value and emit

        This property has id ``3.7``.

    **Methods**:

    .. _ocanumericobserverlist_getlastobservation:

    .. cpp:function:: OcaStatus GetLastObservation(OcaList<OcaFloat64> &Observation)

        Gets the values of the observed property that were reported by the
        most recently emitted Observation event. If the numeric observer has
        never emitted an Observation event, returns a list of IEEE
        not-a-number values. The order of values in the returned list is
        determined by the order of values set by SetObservedProperties, and is
        the same as the order of values returned by the Observation event, and
        the same as the order of object identifications returned by
        GetObservedProperties. The return status indicates whether the value
        has been successfully returned.
