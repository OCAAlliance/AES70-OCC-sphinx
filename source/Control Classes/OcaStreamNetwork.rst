.. cpp:class:: OcaStreamNetwork: OcaAgent

    **DEPRECATED CLASS** *Replaced by class* **OcaMediaTransportNetwork **
    *in version 3 of Connection Management (CM3)* Abstract base class for
    defining network classes to which this device belongs. May be a media
    transport network, a control and monitoring network, or a network that
    does both. There shall be one OcaStreamNetwork instance for each
    network to which the device belongs. This class may be subclassed to
    support networks of various types.

    **Properties**:

    .. _ocastreamnetwork_classid:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaClassID ClassID

        This property is an override of the **OcaRoot** property.

        Type of control protocol used by the network (OCAnn) or NONE if this
        network is not used for control.

        This property has id ``3.3``.

    .. _ocastreamnetwork_idadvertised:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaNetworkNodeID IDAdvertised

        ID by which this device is known on the network, i.e. the host name or
        GUID that this device publishes in the network's directory/discovery
        system.

        This property has id ``3.2``.

    .. _ocastreamnetwork_linktype:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaNetworkLinkType LinkType

        Network link type - e.g. wired Ethernet, USB, ... See the
        OcaNetworkType enum for details. This is a read-only property whose
        value is fixed to the class that is inherited from OcaNetwork to
        implement each specific type of network.

        This property has id ``3.1``.

    .. _ocastreamnetwork_mediaprotocol:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaNetworkMediaProtocol MediaProtocol

        Type of media transport protocol used by the network, or NONE if this
        network is not used for media transport.

    .. cpp:member:: OcaList<OcaNetworkSystemInterfaceID> SystemInterfaces

        Collection of identifiers of system interface(s) used by the network.
        A "system interface" is the system service through which network
        traffic passes into and out of the device -- e.g. a socket. The
        identifier format is system and network dependent; for OCA purposes,
        it is maintained as a variable-length blob which the protocol does not
        inspect.

        This property has id ``3.6``.
