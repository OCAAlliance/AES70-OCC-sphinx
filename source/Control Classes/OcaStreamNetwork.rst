.. cpp:class:: OcaStreamNetwork: OcaAgent

    **DEPRECATED CLASS** *Replaced by class* **OcaMediaTransportNetwork **
    *in version 3 of Connection Management (CM3)* Abstract base class for
    defining network classes to which this device belongs. May be a media
    transport network, a control and monitoring network, or a network that
    does both. There shall be one OcaStreamNetwork instance for each
    network to which the device belongs. This class may be subclassed to
    support networks of various types.

    .. cpp:member:: OcaClassID ClassID

        This property has id ``3.1``.

        This property is an override of the **OcaRoot** property.

    .. cpp:member:: OcaClassVersionNumber ClassVersion

        This property has id ``3.2``.

        This property is an override of the **OcaRoot** property.

    .. cpp:member:: OcaNetworkControlProtocol ControlProtocol

        This property has id ``3.3``.

        Type of control protocol used by the network (OCAnn) or NONE if this
        network is not used for control.

        This property has id ``3.2``.

        ID by which this device is known on the network, i.e. the host name or
        GUID that this device publishes in the network's directory/discovery
        system.

    .. cpp:member:: OcaNetworkLinkType LinkType

        This property has id ``3.1``.

        Network link type - e.g. wired Ethernet, USB, ... See the
        OcaNetworkType enum for details. This is a read-only property whose
        value is fixed to the class that is inherited from OcaNetwork to
        implement each specific type of network.

    .. cpp:member:: OcaNetworkMediaProtocol MediaProtocol

        This property has id ``3.4``.

        Type of media transport protocol used by the network, or NONE if this
