.. cpp:class:: OcaMatrix: OcaWorker

    A matrix is a rectangular array of identical objects (" **members** ") that is coordinate addressable and has sets of common input and output ports. The matrix host does not instantiate these objects, but instead mediates the coordinate addressing, implements the common input and output ports, and provdes certain other aggregate functions. Matrix members may be workers (including blocks), or agents. All members of a matrix must be of the same class. No object may belong to more than one matrix at a time. No object may appear more than once in a given matrix. The complete model of an OCA matrix consists of: 1. One instance of  **OcaMatrix.**  2.  **(N x M) members** , where each member is an instance of a worker or agent class. For any given matrix, this class must be the same for all members, and is referred to as the  **member class.**  Members are sometimes referred to as  **cells**  of the matrix. 3. One additional instance of the member class, called the  **matrix proxy.**  Thus, the  **OcaMatrix**  instance is a container for the two-dimensional collection of its members. Once a matrix is set up, the controller may get and set member properties by the following procedures:  **Get**  To get a property value of member (x1, y1): 1. Controller calls  **OcaMatrix.SetXY(x1, y1)** . This action: - locks the  **OcaMatrix**  instance, and - posts x1 and y1 as coordinates of the object whose property value is to be retrieved. 2. Controller calls the matrix proxy's  **Get**  method for the property value desired. This action causes the  **OcaMatrix**  instance to: - decode the posted x1 and y1 values into a member ONo. - call the given  **Get**  method for the object identified by the decoded ONo. - aggregate the  **OcaResult**  from each  **Get**  call into a consolidated  **OcaResult** . - unlock the  **OcaMatrix**  instance. - return the consolidated  **OcaResult**  to the controller.  **Set**  To set a property value of member (x1, y1), or of row (0, y1) or column (x1, 0) or whole matrix (0,0) 1. Controller calls  **OcaMatrix.SetXY(x1, y1)** . This action: - locks the  **OcaMatrix**  instance, and - posts x1 and y1 as coordinates of the object whose property value is to be changed. 2. Controller calls the matrix proxy's  **Set**  method for the target property. This action causes the  **OcaMatrix**  instance to: - decode the posted x1 and y1 values into a list of target member ONos, as follows: If x1 :raw:html:`&gt;` 0 and y1 :raw:html:`&gt;` 0, the list will be the single ONo of the addressed cell. If x1 = 0 and y1 :raw:html:`&gt;` 0, the list will be the list of ONos of the cells in row y1 . If x1 :raw:html:`&gt;` 0 and y1 = 0, the list will be the list of ONos of the cells in column x1. If x1 = 0 and y1 = 0, the list will be the list of ONos of all cells of the matrix. - call the given  **Set**  method for each target member in the ONo list. - aggregate the  **OcaResult**  from each  **Set**  call into a consolidated  **OcaResult** . - unlock the  **OcaMatrix**  instance.

    **Properties**:

    .. _ocamatrix_classid:

    .. cpp:member:: static const OcaClassID ClassID = "1.1.5"

        Number that uniquely identifies the class. Note that this differs from the object number, which identifies the instantiated object. This property is an override of the  **OcaRoot** property.

        This property has id ``3.1``.

    .. _ocamatrix_classversion:

    .. cpp:member:: static const OcaClassVersionNumber ClassVersion = 2

        Identifies the interface version of the class. Any change to the class definition leads to a higher class version. This property is an override of the  **OcaRoot** property.

        This property has id ``3.2``.

    .. _ocamatrix_x:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaMatrixCoordinate X
