    .. cpp:member:: OcaClassVersionNumber ClassVersion

        This property has id ``3.0``.

        Identifies the interface version of the class. Any change to the class
        definition leads to a higher class version. This property is an
        override of the **OcaRoot** property.

        This method has id ``3.1``.

        value indicates success of the retrieval.
