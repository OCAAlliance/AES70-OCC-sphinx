.. cpp:class:: OcaDynamicsCurve: OcaActuator

    Dynamic compression / expansion curve. **Curve** means a function that
    expresses the relationship of output level to input level. The
    dependent variable (Y) of the curve is output level; the independent
    variable (X) is input level. Every curve is composed of **(n+1)**
    straight-line **segments** joined by **(n)** small fillets called
    **knees** . Each knee occurs at a particular input level value called
    the **threshold.** Each segment is characterized by its **slope.** | /
    | S3 / | S2 / | T1 **-------------** T2 | / | S1 / | / | /
    +------------------------------------ This "drawing" shows a
    three-segment curve. The horizontal axis is input level, vertical axis
    is output level. Algebraically, a curve is a function **Out = Curve(
    In, T[1..n-1], S[1..n], K[1..n-1] )** where **n** is the number of
    segments, and **In** is input level in dBr **Out** is output level in
    dBr **T[1...n-1]** is an array of **thresholds** in dBr **S[1...n]**
    is an array of **slopes** in dBr per dBr, i.e. unitless **K[1..n]** is
    the **knee parameter** , an implementation-dependant parameter that
    specifies the shape of the curve around the knee. Each segment has a
    slope that expresses its ratio of output level to input level. Note
    that this slope is the inverse of what dynamics processors call
    "ratio". For example, a ratio of 2:1 is represented by a curve segment
    with slope 1/2 = 0.5. This model can represent familiar audio dynamics
    elements (we ignore **K[]** in these examples): - Compressor with
    ratio of 2:1 and threshold of 10dBr: **n = 2** **T[1] = 10** **S[1] =
    1** **S[2] = 0.5** - Hard limiter with threshold of 18dBr: **n = 2**
    T[1] = 18 S[1] = 1 S[2] = 0 - Upward expander with ratio of 1.5:1 and
    threshold of -12dBr: **n = 2** T[1] = -12 S[1] = 1 S[2] = 1.5 -
    Downward expander (gate) with ratio of 50:1 and threshold of -45dBr:
    **n = 2** T[1] = -45 S[1] = 50 S[2] = 1 This class,
    **OcaDynamicsCurve,** adds two additional parameters to the basic
    curve mechanism. **Out = Curve( In, T[1..n-1], S[1..n], K[1..n-1] ,
    Floor, Ceiling)** where **In, T[], and S[],** and **K[]** are as
    defined above. **Floor** is the lowest gain (in dBr) that the dynamics
    element is allowed to produce. **Ceiling** is the highest gain (in
    dBr) that the dynamics element is allowed to produce. To show the use
    of **Floor** and **Ceiling** , we revisit some of the examples above
    (again, **K[]** is ignored): - Compressor with ratio of 2:1, threshold
    of 10dBr, and max gain reduction of 20dB: **n = 2** **T[1] = 10**
    **S[1] = 1** **S[2] = 0.5** **Floor = -20** **Ceiling = 0** - Upward
    expander with ratio of 1.5:1, threshold of -12dBr, and max gain boost
    of 4dB: **n = 2** T[1] = -12 S[1] = 1 S[2] = 1.5 Floor = 0 Ceiling =
    4.0 More complex dynamics curves can be modeled by using more segments
    ( **n &gt; 2)** .
