Class Hirarchy:

:ref:`OcaRoot <ocaroot>` :raw:html:`&rarr;` :ref:`OcaManager <ocamanager>` :raw:html:`&rarr;` :ref:`OcaDeviceManager <ocadevicemanager>` 

.. cpp:class:: OcaDeviceManager: OcaManager

    Mandatory manager that contains information relevant to the whole device.  
    
     - Must be instantiated once in every device.
     
    
     - Must have object number 1.
     

    **Properties**:

    .. _ocadevicemanager_classid:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaClassID ClassID

        Number that uniquely identifies the class. Note that this differs from the object number, which identifies the instantiated object. This property is an override of the  **OcaRoot** property.

        This property has id ``3.1``.

    .. _ocadevicemanager_classversion:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaClassVersionNumber ClassVersion

        Identifies the interface version of the class. Any change to the class definition leads to a higher class version. This property is an override of the  **OcaRoot** property.

        This property has id ``3.2``.

    .. _ocadevicemanager_modelguid:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaModelGUID ModelGUID

        Read-only property that identifies the model of the device. Note this property is not equivalent to a MAC address, because (a) MAC addresses identify individual devices, not models, and (b) MAC addresses are Ethernet-specific, but an OCA device need not have an Ethernet port.

        This property has id ``3.1``.

    .. _ocadevicemanager_serialnumber:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaString SerialNumber

        Read-only property that identifies the serial number of the CAP device.

    .. _ocadevicemanager_modeldescription:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaModelDescription ModelDescription

        Read-only property that contains text names for this model, its manufacturer, and its version.

        This property has id ``3.3``.

    .. _ocadevicemanager_devicename:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaString DeviceName

        Name of the device. Should be unique manufacturer-qualified identifier.

        This property has id ``3.4``.

        This property has id ``3.11``.

    .. _ocadevicemanager_message:

    .. cpp:member:: OcaString Message

        Arbitrary text message provided by controller. Display and handling of the text is device-dependent and not defined by OCA.
