1.3.1  OcaDeviceManager
=======================

Extends :ref:`OcaManager <ocamanager>`.

.. cpp:class:: OcaDeviceManager: OcaManager

    Mandatory manager that contains information relevant to the whole
    device.
    
    - Must be instantiated once in every device.
    
    
    - Must have object number 1.
    

    .. cpp:member:: OcaClassID ClassID

        This property has id ``3.0``.

        Number that uniquely identifies the class. Note that this differs from
        the object number, which identifies the instantiated object. This
        property is an override of the **OcaRoot** property.

    .. cpp:member:: OcaClassVersionNumber ClassVersion

        This property has id ``3.0``.

        Identifies the interface version of the class. Any change to the class
        definition leads to a higher class version. This property is an
        override of the **OcaRoot** property.

    .. cpp:member:: OcaModelGUID ModelGUID

        This property has id ``3.0``.

        Read-only property that identifies the model of the device. Note this
        property is not equivalent to a MAC address, because (a) MAC addresses
        identify individual devices, not models, and (b) MAC addresses are
        Ethernet-specific, but an OCA device need not have an Ethernet port.

    .. cpp:member:: OcaString SerialNumber

        This property has id ``3.0``.

        Read-only property that identifies the serial number of the CAP
        device.

    .. cpp:member:: OcaModelDescription ModelDescription

        This property has id ``3.0``.

        Read-only property that contains text names for this model, its
        manufacturer, and its version.

    .. cpp:member:: OcaString DeviceName

        This property has id ``3.0``.

        Name of the device. Should be unique manufacturer-qualified
        identifier.

    .. cpp:member:: OcaUint16 OcaVersion

        This property has id ``3.0``.

        Read-only property that indicates the AES70 version number used by the
        device.

    .. cpp:member:: OcaString DeviceRole

        This property has id ``3.0``.

        Role of device in application (arbitrary).

    .. cpp:member:: OcaString UserInventoryCode

        This property has id ``3.0``.

        Code used for equipment tracking.

    .. cpp:member:: OcaBoolean Enabled

        This property has id ``3.0``.

        Indicates whether the device is enabled (and therefore operational).

    .. cpp:member:: OcaDeviceState State

        This property has id ``3.0``.

        Read-only property that indicates the current state of the device.

    .. cpp:member:: OcaBoolean Busy

        This property has id ``3.0``.

        True iff device is working on something and is not available for OCA
        command activity. Readonly.

    .. cpp:member:: OcaResetCause ResetCause

        This property has id ``3.0``.

        Read-only attribute that indicates the reset cause of the last reset.

    .. cpp:member:: OcaString Message

        This property has id ``3.0``.

        Arbitrary text message provided by controller. Display and handling of
        the text is device-dependent and not defined by OCA.

    .. cpp:member:: OcaList<OcaManagerDescriptor> Managers

        This property has id ``3.0``.

        List of all manager objects instantiated in this device.

    .. cpp:member:: OcaString DeviceRevisionID
