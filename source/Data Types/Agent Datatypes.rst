     - A ramper becomes  **Initialized**  when : The ramper is  **NotInitialized** ; AND  **TargetProperty**  has been set to a valid value; AND  **Goal**  has been set; AND  **Duration**  has been set.
       
    
     - A ramper becomes  **Scheduled**  when It is  **Initialized** ; AND  **T**  **start**  and  **TimeMode**  have been set; AND (Tstart +  **Duration** ) is in the future.
       
    
     - A ramper becomes  **Enabled**  when it is  **Scheduled**  AND receives an  *Enable* command.
       
    
     - A ramper becomes  **Ramping**  when: It is  **Enabled**  and the ramp start time is reached; OR It is  **Initialized** ,  **Scheduled** , or  **Enabled**  and a  *Start*  command is received.
       
    
     - Completion of a ramp or Receipt of a  *Halt*  command causes the state to become:  **Scheduled** , if Tstart, Time Mode have been set; AND (Tstart + Duration) is in the future. Otherwise,  **Initialized.**

    .. cpp:enumerator:: Ramping = 5

        Ramper is currently executing a ramp.
